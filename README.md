#### A budding software developer 🧑‍💻 and an ex-architect 📐 

## 🚀 About Me
I am a second-year computer science student at [**Algoma University**](https://algomau.ca/).

🔎 Currently, I am **seeking an internship** in software engineering to learn the intricacies of software development at a product level and gain exposure to different stages of the software development life cycle.

❤️ I love to code, and as a curious and passionate programmer, I have taught myself multiple web technologies and techniques. Primarily, I use Java for application programming, HTML || CSS || JavaScript for web development, and Python for scripting.
